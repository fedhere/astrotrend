==========

creates a word cloud from the title of the arxiv.org preprints posted in the past week. requires a few packages, including urllib2, PIL and BeautifulSoup (for the latter a local copy of BeautifulSoup.py would do)

no installation required: just grab the python codes. the font used is provided for convenience, but of course it can be changed by feeding the appropriate path to the got in getwords.py

to run just type python getwords.py

it saves a png image of the cloud. it may take a minute to create it.
